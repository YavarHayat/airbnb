# Project Overview

What if property owners on Airbnb get recommendations on the appropriate listing price to maximize revenue? There is nothing like it. To help the property owners, in this assignment, you’ll define the business-relevant metric and aggregate data across different tables to propose an appropriate listing price. 

Here, you’ll use an ML-based approach to arrive at the recommendations on the listing price which will also help the business stakeholders to understand how the ML model works. In this process, you’ll: 
•	Finalize your code and push it to the GitHub repository or create well-structured collab notebooks or Kaggle kernels. 
•	Ensure your code is well structured.
•	Break down the code into modular files or notebooks. 
•	Finalize your findings in a markdown document and push it to your GitHub account or create Kaggle kernels and collab notebooks.
•	Present your results in PowerPoint and push the PowerPoint to SlideShare.
•	Explain the complicated ML model to business stakeholders.

# Problem Statement

Property owners on Airbnb are unsure of the listing price to maximize revenue. Can an ML-based solution suggest an appropriate listing price to the owner when they try to list a property out for rent?
